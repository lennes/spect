<p>The aim of the <b>Speech Corpus Toolkit for Praat (SpeCT)</b> is to provide an organized inventory of well-documented Praat scripts that can be easily downloaded, modified and used in order to perform small tasks during the various stages of building, organizing, annotating, analysing, searching and exporting data from a <A HREF="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Speech_corpus">speech corpus</A>.</p>

  <li>These Praat scripts were written by <a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4735-3017">
         Mietta Lennes</a>
         . They should provide some functionalities and tools for the <a href="http://www.praat.org/">
         Praat </a>
         program for phonetic analysis (see the Praat home page at <a href="http://www.praat.org/">
         http://www.praat.org/</a>
         ). Praat is being developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink in 
the   University   of Amsterdam.</li>
  <li> These scripts are distributed under the <a href="LICENSE">
        GNU General Public License</a>. The scripts are distributed without any warranty: I do not guarantee
   that  the scripts work in your system, and I will not be held responsible
   for any  harm or damage caused by their use.&nbsp;Please make sure that

  <li> Please refer any interested parties to this web page (<a href="https://lennes.github.io/spect/">https://lennes.github.io/spect/</a>).</li>
</ul>
<b>How to run and modify the scripts:</b> see Scripting tutorial    in the
built-in Help pages within the <a href="http://www.praat.org/">Praat</a>
         program (see the Help menu in the Objects list). <br>
<b>Requirements: </b>In the Requirements column, you can find information 
  on what type of objects have to be selected in the Object list or what sort
  of files are needed in order to run each script. This is important especially
  when you want to create new buttons  or menu commands to use the script.<br>
<b>Compatibility note: </b>Some of the scripts were originally written  
 in  a Windows machine, some in Macintosh, and some in Linux. All of them
  should  work in any platform running Praat, but you may want to change,
e.g.,  the default path for files according to your system. The version number
tells   you the Praat version on which the script has been tested. Sometimes
the  commands change in Praat, and consequently all of the scripts may not
work  in all Praat versions.<br>

  The script was written for a situation where people want to extract shorter
 sections of a LongSound object for labeling, but still they want to be able
 to later append the labeled sections back into the big TextGrid file. All
 you have to do is make a big TextGrid for the LongSound and mark boundaries
 at the starting points of each extracted region. It is also a good idea
to  label the extracted intervals with the filenames. This way, you can later
 find the correct places for replacements. <br>

Moreover, basic statistics (min, max, mean, median, stdev) of each pitch object are saved into a tabulated text file in the selected scale. Curves can be drawn as plain lines or speckled, and either in only black lines or in different colours and line types. You may let Praat "normalize time" in order to compare the general contour shapes, or you may choose to plot the curves in absolute time scale.
       <br>For advanced users: The curves can be drawn in different colours according to, e.g., speaker ID or other group code that is contained by the file name. (See instructions within the script file.)<br>
